# Olympic Games App

## Installation

First, install the projects dependencies running:

```npm i```

## Development

For development, run the next command from the root directory:

```npm run dev```

This command runs the GraphQL API and the React Application in parallel. It runs both commands in development mode
so this command must not be used to deploy to production.

## Test

For testing, run the next command from the root directory:

```npm test```

This command runs all the test from the GraphQL and the React Application in parallel
